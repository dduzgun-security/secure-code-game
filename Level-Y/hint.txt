Did you find the typo that allows an attacker to guess/enumerate valid emails?
OMG! Does Lumberjack really log emails (twice in the code) and passwords (once in the code)?

If you are stuck and can't run the code, don't forget to create a go.mod file.
Something like "go mod init secure-code-game" at the same directory as code.go should work.
